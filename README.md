3.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    In the `backend` folder, create a new file named `.env` and add the following variables. Replace the placeholder values with your own.
    ```
    PORT=5001
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
